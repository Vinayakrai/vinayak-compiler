# Vinayak Compiler

**Vinayak Compiler** is a basic compiler program written in C++ that simulates lexical analysis and parsing processes. It serves as a foundational tool for understanding compiler design and implementation, especially for students or anyone learning how compilers work internally.

## 🚀 Features

- **Lexical Analysis**: Tokenizes source code into keywords, identifiers, numbers, etc.
- **Syntax Checking**: Basic validation for correct syntax structures.
- **Custom Language Support**: Parses a predefined mini-language for demonstration.
- **Educational Purpose**: Ideal for compiler design coursework and experimentation.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- **C++ Compiler**: Such as GCC or MinGW.
- Works on Windows, Linux, or macOS platforms.

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vinayakrai/vinayak-compiler.git
cd vinayak-compiler
```

2. **Compile the Program**:

Using g++:

```bash
g++ vinayak_compiler.cpp -o vinayak_compiler
```

3. **Run the Program**:

```bash
./vinayak_compiler
```

On Windows:

```bash
vinayak_compiler.exe
```

## 🚀 Usage

- Input your code as a text file or directly into the program when prompted.
- The compiler will output tokens and syntax analysis results.
- Use sample inputs provided (if any) for testing and experimentation.
